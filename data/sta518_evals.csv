It is hard to remember all of the details, especially when what we are learning is essentially another language.","I'm not very fond of the group work during class. Mainly because our group of 3 are all at different skill levels . We work at different speeds and it's definitely not a collaborative effort as intended. When I am stuck it seems its annoying to slow another groupmate down to help. I would prefer to do this group work outside of class and have more examples of how to use the code we've read about during class. More collaborative practice as a whole class would help towards the more individual components such as the apps and projects.

Another point I have is that it feels odd that we need to reach out for problems to complete in order to get a second checkmark for learning targets. It would be nice if these were assigned up front so we can work on them on our own time, instead of having another thing to schedule. "
